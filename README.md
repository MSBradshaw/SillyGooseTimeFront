Look at the big spinning goose!

# Deployment instructions
To launch the app locally, first go to `app/` then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

One can deploy the website to AWS S3 (w/ CloudFront as CDN) by executing `app/deploy.sh`, but you'll need credentials if you want to do this for the first time. Ping @junipertcy for details.
